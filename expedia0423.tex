\chapter{Background Introduction}
Many companies have internal search engines on their websites where visitors can search for products or services. Popular keywords and search filters can provide insights into customer behaviour. Many companies want to harness the power of machine learning to suggest products to users based on their searches. One of these companies is Expedia. Their website allows users to search for hotels and plan vacations. They hosted a Kaggle competition, "Expedia Hotel Recommendation" in April 2016 so that competitors can recommend hotels to users based on their search data.
\section{Data}
The training set includes search data (approximately 37 million search events) from 2013 and 2014. The features are search parameters such as dates, locations and whether the search resulted in a hotel being booked. Expedia grouped hotels into 100 hotel clusters based on their similarity. The testing set consists of approximately 2.5 million search events from 2015 which resulted in hotel bookings. They have the same features as the training set. The goal is to predict which hotel cluster the user booked for each search event.
\section{Evaluation}
For each search event, up to five hotel clusters can be predicted. Submissions are scored using the Mean Average Precision at 5 (MAP@5). The formula is
\[MAP@5=\frac{1}{|U|}\sum_{u=1}^{|U|}\sum_{k=1}^{5}P(k)\]
where U is the testing set and P(k) is the precision at the k\textsuperscript{th} prediction. It calculates the mean precision of each search event and then averages them. For a given search event, if the correct class appears in the k\textsuperscript{th} position in the list of five predictions, the average precision for that event is $\frac{1}{k}$. If it is not in the list, the average precision is 0. For example, if the correct hotel cluster is 3 and the list of predicted clusters is "10 3 52 98 75", then it would receive an average precision of $\frac{1}{2}$ as the correct cluster is ranked second. The MAP@5 score from random guessing is 0.022.

\chapter{Methods}

\section{Initial Approaches}
\subsection{Data Preprocessing}
Since the training set is very large (4 GB), incomplete entries that contained missing values were filtered out. Furthermore, search events that did not lead to hotel bookings were removed because they may not reflect the search patterns of users who actually book hotels. Moreover, time stamp features such as check-in and check-out dates were split into different attributes for years, months and days. Lastly, highly correlated variables were removed. For example, a user's continent is correlated with their country so it is redundant. In the testing set, some entries were missing a destination distance so mean values were imputed.\\

\subsection{Algorithms}
After processing the data, various machine learning algorithms were applied to it to predict hotel clusters for the events in the testing set. The following methods were used: 
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{0.1em}
	\item Linear Discriminant Analysis 
	\item k-Nearest Neighbours with Hamming distance as the distance metric 
	\item Random Forests with various numbers of trees 
	\item Naive Bayes 
	\item XGBoost  
	\item AdaBoost with various numbers of trees 
\end{itemize}
However, none of these methods produced a MAP@5 score above 0.105.

\section{New Approach for Data Engineering}
\subsection{Frequency Tables}
Since the aforementioned machine learning algorithms failed to successfully classify most of the search events, it is evident that additional feature engineering techniques are required to pre-process the data. Thus, frequency tables were created for each categorical feature to utilize rule-based and count-based learning. For a given feature, the rows of its table correspond to values of the feature while each column corresponds to a hotel cluster. Each entry represents the number of events, in the training set, with a particular feature value and hotel cluster.\\

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
  \hline
  % after \\: \hline or \cline{col1-col2} \cline{col3-col4} ...
 User ID& Cluster 0& Cluster 1& ...& Cluster 99 \\
  \hline \hline
 1  & 1 & 70& ...& 5 \\\hline
 ...  & ... & ...& ...& ... \\\hline
 n  & 4& 1& ...& 10 \\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

For example, based on this table, user 1 has looked at hotel cluster 0 once, cluster 1 70 times and cluster 99 five times.

\subsection{Ranking Algorithm}
The following algorithm predicts five classes for a search event.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Extract the selected features from the event.
  \item For each feature, retrieve the n most frequent clusters from the row corresponding to the feature value of the event.
  \item Pool the most frequent clusters from each table into a list. Clusters with high frequencies in multiple tables will be recorded multiple times in the list.
  \item Rank the clusters based on how many times they occur in the list and select the top five.
\end{enumerate} 
Frequency tables for some features can hurt the predictive accuracy so only features that had a significant influence on the predictions were included. To determine which features to remove, a random forest was applied to the training set and the Mean Decrease in Accuracy (MDA) of each categorical feature was computed. It is calculated by generating permutations of the feature values and computing the average decrease in accuracy. The most influential features (with MDA $\geq$ 0.05) were determined to be the user id, the region of the user, the search destination id, the country of the hotel, the market of the hotel, and (to a lesser extent) the day of the week that a user checked-in and out of a hotel. The ranking algorithm was performed using the tables of these features with n=5 and 10 classes retrieved from each table. It was also run without the date features. The results are summarized in Table 1.
